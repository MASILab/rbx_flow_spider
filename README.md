RecobundlesX is a multi-atlas, multi-parameters version of Recobundles [1, 2]. It is optimized for whole brain coverage using 39 major well-known white matter pathways. The atlas is a customized population average from 20 UKBioBank [3] and 20 Human Connectome Project [4] datasets co-registered to MNI152 space.

This atlas was made to cover as much spatial extend as possible and explore as much shape variability as possible. Recobundles is when run 27 times with bundle-specific paramters and the results of each execution are used in a majority-vote approach. This is inspired from the state-of-the-art in medical images segmentation (before machine-learning) [5,6].

Then, a shape-based pruning is applied to each bundle to remove inconsistent or spurious streamlines (outliers) [7].
